<a href="http://www.twitter.com/blank_waves">@blank_waves</a>
<p>A Twitter bot I built with Node.js that aggregates a random image chosen from various curated web archives. After the image is posted, it is then deleted from the source, never to be posted again. The intent of the bot is to inject somewhat pleasing, interesting or never before seen visuals to its followers timeline every hour, breaking up the constant stream of text based tweets.
