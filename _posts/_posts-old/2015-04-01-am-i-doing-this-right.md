Throughout all the programming courses I've been taking, I would start to worry that after the course I won't be able to type out lines of code as if I'm composing a symphony. However, I now realize this is not a worry that's grounded in the reality of what it is to be a programmer. After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/30miri/all_i_do_at_work_is_google_how_to_do_things_then/) post on Reddit, I felt more at ease about the fact that I'm constatly searching Google to find code and solutions instead of actually writing code.

Nearly every comment on that post was from an experienced programmer affirming that this is standard practice and completely normal. 
I kept reading the same expression over and over, "There's no use reinventing the wheel". In other words, whatever you are trying to code, it's already been successfully coded before. So why not use code that another programmer has made (which could have been taken from *another* previous programmer) and build upon that? Similar approaches are common in art, music and engineering, so why would there be an exception in programming?

Of course, it's still important to be able to type lines of code from memory, but this will come with experience and repetition. What's important at the novice level, is having a solid understanding of the language you are working in so you can modify the code and know how to properly run tests and debug.

Most of my experience so far has been a cycle of searching for the right code, fitting it in with the rest of the code and figuring out why it's not working the way I want it to. Then when coming across an error, copy and paste the error into Google and repeat the process. So it's refreshing to realize that this is common programming practice and not considered cutting corners.

Learning to program is more than just learning syntax. It's just as important to know what it means to *be* a programmer. Using any tools and resources available to make something work is an essential part of the job.
