Bookmarks from May and June consisting of developer tools, resources and some tech news. Since I didn't share any links from last month, I made an effort to post some quality resources I've bookmarked from the last 2 months. I hope you find these links as useful as I have. Happy clicking!


[Sublime Text 3 Cheat Sheet (OSX)](http://www.cheatography.com/martinprins/cheat-sheets/sublime-text-3-osx/)

Sublime Text is a powerful text editor that can be used as an IDE, so knowing your way around it can make your a powerful developer. Now that I am using Sublime Text at work, it's even more important to be fast and effecient in my developer environment. Learning Sublime commands not only helps increase productivity, but it cuts down on time spent switching between mouse and keyboard.


[xcodula](http://xcodula.com/)

This site is run by fellow nerd Jason Tennant who contacted me after reading my post on going [From Zero to Hired](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/from-zero-to-hired/). His site is very resourceful and shares the same overall purpose of my blog so I thought it would be worth linking. Since I've began learning PHP and MySQL, this site has been a very helpful resource for me. Definitely go check out xcodula if you are learning PHP or looking for some other helpful developer resources. Also be on the lookout for a collaboration from yours truly.


[WebAssembly](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-webassembly-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-61256ec5a8f6)

WebAssembly is a binary format for the web created by Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and others. What this means is instead of using the browser's engine to parse JavaScript files, WebAssembly will use binary format which can compress and parse JavaScript files up to 23x faster. "Yesterday, Brendan Eich dropped a bomb on the web development community: The web platform is getting a new low-level binary compile format that will do a better job at being a compiler target than JavaScript." It is exciting to see the major browser vendors working together to essentially make browsing the internet a lot faster.


[PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/)

As mentioned above, I have been learning PHP and found this gem of a resource for learning PHP. One of the challenges with finding a good resource to learn PHP is making sure you are learning best practices, which in the case of PHP may be a problem since there are a lot of old and dated tutorials. PHP The Right Way uses popular and current coding standards which makes it an excellent resource for beginners like me. It is even up to date with the current stable version of PHP and provides information on the changes made in the latest versions.


[UnCSS](https://github.com/giakki/uncss)

Since I started my first project as a developer, I thought a tool that gets rid of unused CSS would be extremely helpful, especially when working with huge CSS files such as Bootstrap or Foundation. Recently I found this tool which does exactly that. Here's how it works:</p>
1. The HTML files are loaded by PhantomJS and JavaScript is executed.
2. Used stylesheets are extracted from the resulting HTML.
3. The stylesheets are concatenated and the rules are parsed by css-parse.
4. ``document.querySelector`` filters out selectors that are not found in the HTML files.
5. The remaining rules are converted back to CSS.
