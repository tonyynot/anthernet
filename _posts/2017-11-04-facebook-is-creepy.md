In a recent inteview with Stanford, Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya revealed some startling concerns about the increasingly invasive and creepy platform.  

> "I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops weâ€™ve created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. You are being programmed". [(Source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk&feature=youtu.be&t=1282)

Facebook's lack of concern over user privacy has been an ongoing issue since its beginnings. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg has also had his fair share of alarming interviews where he was pressed about privacy issues. Perhaps the [most infamous Zuckerberg interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXrKKwHmPz4) being from back in 2010 where he is visibly very uncomfortable when questioned about user privacy and personality profiling. He starts sweating, stuttering, avoids answering the question and if all of that doesn't sound cringey enough, he eventually has to take off his blue Facebook hoodie after sweating like he's being interrogated under a heat lamp. 

But let's give the devil his due, the Facebook engineers know exactly what they are doing and have no intenet to stop. Sean Parker, Zuckerberg's former partner and former president of Facebook, admitted in a recent interview that [Facebook was designed to exploit human vulnerability](https://www.axios.com/sean-parker-facebook-exploits-a-vulnerability-in-humans-2507917325.html). In fact, what Parker revealed in his interview is almost identical to what Palihapitiya said in his.

> "That means that we needed to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever ... It's a social validation feedback loop ... You're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology ... [The inventors] understood this, consciously, and we did it anyway."

The truth is, Facebook simply does not have reason to care about your privacy. All the privacy breaches are warranted to them, because their users are allowing it and encouraging it just by signing up. Between Facebook and Google, the two platforms pretty much have a monopoly on personal data just by sheer population and volume of data collected with nearly 2 billion users each. They have access to more personal data than any centralized platform has ever had.
