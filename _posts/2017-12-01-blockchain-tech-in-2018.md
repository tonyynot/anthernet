Cryptocurrencies are not only changing how we think about money, but how we use money on a daily basis. However, they are more than just nerdy alternatives to using paper money, they are also disruptive techologies that seek to separate money and state while providing decentralized platforms and solutions to areas that have traditionally been controlled by central banks and governments. With Bitcoin surpassing $1800 in 2017, the entire crypto market has been booming with thousands of new cryptocurrencies that offer unique and promising solutions to current and future technology. 

So here are some cryptocoins to look out for in 2018, all of them currently ranging from $0.11 to $9 (as of December 2017) so if you are a new investor looking to diversify and hold long term, you can actually buy many of these coins at a time unlike some of the more expensive coins. Of course these are all highly speculative technologies in their early phase, as is any other blockchain tech, but even if you are not an investor, some of the solutions these technologies give us a glimse into a world that will undoubtedly be experienced in the near future.

## [OmiseGo](https://omisego.network/) [OMG]  
OmiseGo is a decentralized exchange built on a smart contract framework called [Plasma](http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf), hosting an open-source digital wallet platform from [Omise](https://www.omise.co/), connecting mainstream payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. OmiseGo is both fiat and crypto-friendly which will solve one of the main problems with entering the cryptocurrency market - easily trading altcoins without going through more than 1 exchange. OmiseGo is also cross-chain compatible, Ethereum based and "designed to enable financial inclusion and disrupt existing institutions". Their slogan is "Unbank the Banked" as they aim to eliminate the need for corporate institutions acting as the middleman when making digital transactions.  

## [Raiblocks](https://raiblocks.net/) [XRB]  
RaiBlocks can be best understood as what Bitcoin is supposed to be. It's main usage is as a currency and technically it functions as the best one on the market. XRB offers instant transactions with zero fees and has infinite scalability. 

## [Request Network](https://request.network/#/) [REQ]  
Most of us already use Paypal or Venmo to request payments from others. Both these platforms rely on sharing banking information and relying on the bank or another 3rd party to approve the transactions, in turn taking anywhere from 1% - 6% in commission fees. Request Network offers a secure and decentralized p2p solution to this problem, bypassing banks and 3rd party mediators all together. Request Network is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is "designed to be flexible, last hundreds of years and work with IoT" according to their website.  

*Please note that I am not suggesting anyone invest in these technologies. If you are interested, do your own research and make educated investments.
