*Please note that I am not suggesting anyone invest in these technologies. If you are interested, do your own research and make educated investments.

## Cardano [ADA]()
Update testing

## [IOTA](https://iota.org/)  
Perhaps the best way to describe IOTA is the economy of the internet of things. IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol launched in 2015 that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless ‘Tangle’. The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-resistant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose digital currency 'iota' has a fixed money supply with zero inflationary cost. What sets IOTA apart from other blockchain tech is that it offers zero-fee transactions and doesn't have a fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second. IOTA also has no separation between users and validators (miners / stakers); rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization. With IOTA, data can be transferred and micropayments can be made through applications for fractions of a cent with zero fees.

## Vertcoin [VTC]


## ChainLink [LINK]  
ChainLink is a fully decentralised oracle network that allows smart contracts to connect to pull off-blockchain data (such as APIs and bank account payments), push data to external off-blockchain services (e.g. payments to existing bank accounts, and connect with other blockchains (e.g. between public and private chains)[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/wiki/index). For those unfamiliar with Oracle networks, they provide data from a centralized service that leaves smart contracts trustless and easily manipulated. ChainLink serves a market demand as a solution to this problem.

## Request Network [REQ](https://request.network/#/)  
Most of us already use Paypal or Venmo to request payments from others. Both these platforms rely on sharing banking information and relying on the bank or another 3rd party to approve the transactions, in turn taking anywhere from 1% - 6% in commission fees. Request Network offers a secure and decentralized p2p solution to this problem, bypassing banks and 3rd party mediators all together. Request Network is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is "designed to be flexible, last hundreds of years and work with IoT" according to their website.
