description: A brief look at the nearly impossibly esoteric programming language called Malboge. The code for "Hello World" looks more like a mess of random keystrokes than actual lines of code.

Malbolge, invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, is an esoteric programming language which is appropriately named after the eigth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno. It is supposedly the most difficult language to program in, intentionally created to be nearly impossible to code. 

Just take a look at how "Hello World" is written in Malbolge:

As you can see, this code block looks like I might have just repeatedly slammed my keyboard in a fit of rage, but according to the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge#.22Hello_World.21.22_in_Malbolge) article, it's legit. To see "Hello World" coded in over 450 programming languages, check out [The Hello World Collection](http://helloworldcollection.de/).
