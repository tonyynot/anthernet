Over the years I've spent browsing Github, I have found a number of great resources and usages of open source documentation. Some of the collections and lists that I found more interesting were typically security or cryptography related, so I thought I'd share some of these great resources here.  

[Awesome Cryptography](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography)  
A curated list of cryptography resources and links.  

[Android Clipboard Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/grepx/android-clipboard-security/blob/master/README.md)  
Here's a project that demonstrates a security flaw in Android's API that allows any installed application to listen to copy & paste actions on the clipboard. Reminder never to copy & paste your private keys using your device.  

[Cypherpunk Research](https://github.com/tombusby/cypherpunk-research)  
This is a repository dedicated to compiling information about Cypherpunks, the history of the movement, and the people/events of note.

[macOS Security &;amp Privacy Guide](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide)
This is a guide for macOS power users who wish to adopt enterprise-standard security, but is also suitable for novice users with an interest in improving their privacy and security on a Mac.  

[Awesome Hacking](https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking)  
A huge collection of (awesome) lists for hackers, pentesters & security researchers.
