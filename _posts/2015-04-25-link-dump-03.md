I spent some of my downtime this month exploring the [Chrome Experiments](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/) page. If you are unfamiliar with Chrome Experiments, its basically a virtual playground of nearly 100 various browser based art projects, mostly ran using WebGL. In this month's Link Dump, I am sharing a few of my favorites that I've come across.

Note: Most of the sites require WebGL support which may not be supported by some older browsers. Also used is a 3D JavaScript framework called [three.js](http://threejs.org/).


## [The Wilderness Downtown](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/)

Arcade Fire happens to be one of my favorite bands ever. For their 2010 album "The Suburbs", the site was used to turn your childhood neighborhood into an interactive music video. The Chrome experiment was built using "choreographed windows, interactive flocking, custom rendered maps, real-time compositing, procedural drawing, 3D canvas rendering..." according to the [description](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/arcadefire/). It makes me wish there was a browser based version of Radiohead's gorgeous [Polyfauna](http://www.universaleverything.com/projects/polyfauna/) app.


## [The Dilla Dimension](http://www.dilladimension.com)

An interactive short film based the legendary [J Dilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla) album [Donuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donuts_(album)) which happens to be one of my favorite albums ever (I'm sensing a theme here). The project was released this month to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the album's release and the life of "one of hiphop’s most innovative & influential figures." Based on the experiment overview, "it uses a league of new technologies to create a completely digital film that's made with real-time programmed effects."


## [Mosh - Glitch yo self](http://getmosh.io/)

I have spent more time than I'd like to admit playing around on this site. It is powered by JavaScript, WebGL (like most Chrome Experiments) and [GLSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) which is a shading language based in WebGL. Mosh is a web app that "allows you to apply creative ‘glitch’ filters to images and the web cam." By pressing the "MOSH" button, random filters and glitch combinations are generated, producing some trippy visuals to look at yourself through.


## [An Hour on GitHub](http://graphoverflow.com/graphs/an-hour-on-github.html)

This experiment uses a 3D visual data grid that shows the actives logged in one hour of GitHub. It is described on the site that the grid "represents the total 13781 events an average of around 120 events in each 30 seconds. Each block is the collected event in each 30 seconds." A quick look and you'll get the idea, but it shows the possibilities of using 3D particle grids to visualize social data. Personally, I would like to see this concept implemented to display visual data in real-time and the potential certainly is there.
