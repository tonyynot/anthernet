  <p>As you can probably tell, I am not a writer by any means. This blog was originally created for sharing my experiences and lessons in learning to code and since then has evolved along with my ever-growing interest in technology. My pursuit to become a better programmer will never cease and neither will my desire to learn and share knowledge, so maybe I shoud keep this blog around for a while.
    <p>Anthernet is for:</p>
    <p>> Sharing resources and utilities for writing code.</p>
    <p>> Advocating open source and decentralized solutions.</p>
    <p>> Promoting digital privacy and online freedom.</p>
