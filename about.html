<h2>Yours Truly</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Anthony. I have a B.A. from Eastern University where I studied Philosophy and Religion. After a 14 month stint teaching English in South Korea, I decided to move back to Philadelphia in late 2013 where I am currently pursing a career in web development. I am a lover of music, art, tech, video games, photography, travel and craft beer. </p>

<p>In the development world, I enjoy responsive design, discovering new tools and libraries, exploring web frameworks, contributing to open source and learning blockchain tech. To further my abilities, I'm always looking for programming courses and books to sharpen my skills. When I'm not coding, I am expanding and enjoying my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/alramella/collection" target="_blank">record collection</a>, reading, investing in cryptocurrency, riding my bike, hiking or playing some video games but very rarely will I do all those things at the same time.</p>

<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>If you haven't noticed, I'm not a writer by any means. I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges learning code along with some helpful insights and resources as I teach myself. It was built with <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator powered by <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I designed and coded the site myself while learning <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Read more about how I built this site <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/new-blog-design/">here</a>.
