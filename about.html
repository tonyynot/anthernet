<h3>Yours Truly</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Anthony. I have a B.A. from Eastern University where I studied Philosophy and Religion. After a 14 month stint teaching English in South Korea, I decided to move back to Philadelphia in late 2013 where I am currently pursing a career in web development. I am a lover of music, art, tech, video games, photography, travel and craft beer. </p>

<p>In the development world, I enjoy contributing to open source, beta testing, web frameworks and responsive design. Since I'm still learning, I'm always looking for programming courses and books to sharpen my skills. When I'm not coding, I am expanding and enjoying my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/alramella/collection" target="_blank">record collection</a>, riding my bike, hiking or playing some PS4 but very rarely will I do all those things at the same time.</p>

<h3>This site</h3>
<p>I'm not a writer by any means. I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights and resources while in turn teaching myself. It was built with <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator powered by <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I desgined and coded the site myself while learning <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Read more about how I built this site <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/new-blog-design/">here</a>.
