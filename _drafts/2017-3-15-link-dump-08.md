YouTube's increasing problem of demonetization and censorship has created a demand for decentralized video sharing platforms such as [DTube](https://d.tube/), [BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/) and [Flixxo](http://www.flixxo.com/). However, it goes without saying that until one of these platforms really takes off, YouTube is still king for finding the best video content on the web. It's also a great source for learning about technology and computing among everything else you can learn for free on YouTube. But we are just here for the nerdy stuff, right? So for this link dump I thought I'd share some of my favorite tech YouTubers.
