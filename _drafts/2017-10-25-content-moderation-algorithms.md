We know that there are between 800-1,000 Facebook moderators worldwide and that they make up 1/3 of Facebookâ€™s full-time workforce. They speak 24 different langauges and many of the positions are outsourced to countries like India and the Philippines. The algorithm simply sorts through some various categories that have been reported like hate speech, harrassment, sexually explicit material, violence etc. Then the reports are sent to these moderators, who make $1 an hour unless they click through 4,000 images in which they will get $4 an hour, so theres actually a big incentive to rapidly clicking through content programatically. It means they have .9 seconds to make a sound moral judgement on each piece of content. Also, these content moderators are mostly foreigners and come from all different walks of life, so they are all judging this content through a different ethical framework. 

But perhaps the creepiest part of facebook is that they actually use all the data they collect about you to determine things like what your sexuality is and to generate a personality profile, which is used to predict your future actions.

for information in a digital age to be easily accessible to billions of people around the world, there simply cannot be restrictions. That would mean a small group of people get to determine what information is not acceptable for the entire world, regardless of the intent of the user accessing it. Who is granted this type of authority, and by whom and why is it given?

People should still be able to access graphic, sensative and controversial content just as easily as anything else and make their own judgements, criticisms and formulate their own responses about it, with their own reasoning and critical thinking skills. That's why many of us fell in love with the internet in the first place - cyberspace is where we could actually be free. We have individual reponsibility to discern if something is "fake news" ourselves, we don't need a small group of authoritarian thought police with shared political bias to filter it for us. All content needs to be equally accessible, especially if you believe in democracy, because as long as there are powerful centralized media platforms enabling mass propoganda and supression of information, democracy has been hijacked. Its been hijacked by the hivemind of those who control the information, even if they think its well intended.
