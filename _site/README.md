I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights, resources and articles. It was built with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), a static website generator powered by [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I desgined and coded the site myself while learning [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

Note: This repository is for my personal use only.

### Theme
If you like the design of my blog and would like to use it for your own, please fork and clone from the [Idioteque theme](https://github.com/tonyynot/idioteque-theme) repository and not this one. Any improvements or fixes to the theme can be submitted in a pull request so the theme can be improved over time. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
