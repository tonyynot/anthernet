<p>Since I have been relatively busy the past month or so, I haven’t had much time to write so I thought I’d share these insightful quotes I have been collecting. The quotes are on miscellaneous topics that I’ve found useful in one way or another. My plan is that this page is updated intermittently and the list of quotes grows over time.</p>

<p>“You didn’t come into this world. You came out of it, like a wave from the ocean. You are not a stranger here.” -Alan Watts</p>

<p>“Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.” ―Thomas Merton</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.” -Haruki Murakami</p>

<p>“A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.” -Hunter S. Thompson</p>
