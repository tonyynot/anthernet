<p>Cryptocurrencies are not only changing how we think about money, but how we use money on a daily basis. However, they are more than just nerdy alternatives to using paper money, they are also disruptive techologies that provide decentralized platforms and solutions in areas that have traditionally been controlled by central banks and governments. With the total cryptocurrency market cap reaching $759 billion in 2017, the entire crypto market has been experiencing exponential growth with thousands of new cryptocurrencies that offer unique and promising solutions to current and future technology.</p>

<p>So here are some cryptocoins to look out for in 2018, of course these are all highly speculative technologies in their early phase, as is any other blockchain tech, but even if you are not an investor, some of the solutions these technologies give us a glimse into a world that will undoubtedly be experienced in the near future. I encourage any readers to make educated decisions when investing and to be sure you are familiar with the technologies, competition, criticisms, market demand and community for any cryptocurrencies before investing.</p>

<h2 id="vechain-vet"><a href="https://www.vechain.com/#/">VeChain</a> [VET]</h2>
<p>What VeChain aims to do is to build a distributed business ecosystem that is trustless and transparent. This eliminates the trust issue involved in business transactions between two parties. VeChain is the solution to verifying the authenticity of products in the food, beverage, agricultural and fashion industry by adding the products’ RFID to the blockchain. Since the blockchain is trustless and immutable, it cannot be altered or manipulated by a centralized source. It’s worth noting that VeChain has recently established a <a href="https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf">national level partnership</a> with the Chinese government in an effort to improve the quality of export goods.<br />

<h2 id="quantstamp-qsp"><a href="https://quantstamp.com/">Quantstamp</a> [QSP]</h2>
<p>Quantstamp describes itself as being “the first scalable security-audit protocol designed to find vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts.” The team is a group of PHD wielding engineers who’s mission is to help developers produce more reliable code through smart contract auditing, improving the overall security and verification of the smart contract infrastructure. This is a much needed service especially that there is an undeniable demand for as there are still some common vulnerabilites in Ethereum/Solidity. The more audits that are requested, the higher the value of the QSP tokens become since submitting a request requires purchasing QSP token.<br />

<h2 id="omisego-omg"><a href="https://omisego.network/">OmiseGo</a> [OMG]</h2>
<p>OmiseGo is a decentralized exchange built on a smart contract framework called <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">Plasma</a>, hosting an open-source digital wallet platform from <a href="https://www.omise.co/">Omise</a>, connecting mainstream payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. OmiseGo is both fiat and crypto-friendly which will solve one of the main problems with entering the cryptocurrency market - easily trading altcoins without going through more than 1 exchange. OmiseGo is also cross-chain compatible, Ethereum based and “designed to enable financial inclusion and disrupt existing institutions”. Their slogan is “Unbank the Banked” as they aim to eliminate the need for corporate institutions acting as the middleman when making digital transactions.<br />

<h2 id="raiblocks-xrb"><a href="https://raiblocks.net/">Raiblocks</a> [XRB]</h2>
<p>RaiBlocks can be best understood as what Bitcoin is supposed to be. It’s main usage is as a currency and with instant transactions, zero fees and infinite scalability, XRB is the most efficient coin on the market. The problem of scaling to mass adoption is an ongoing issue with many cryptocurrencies, most notoriously seen as the core issue behind the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-civil-war-what-you-need-to-know-1501508664">Bitcoin civil war</a> but RaiBlocks aims to solve this problem by making XRB ininitely scalable. With no transaction fees it makes XRB an ideal coin for both trading and commerce.<br />

<h2 id="request-network-req"><a href="https://request.network/#/">Request Network</a> [REQ]</h2>
<p>Most of us already use Paypal or Venmo to request payments from others. Both these platforms rely on sharing banking information and relying on the bank or another 3rd party to approve the transactions, in turn taking anywhere from 1% - 6% in commission fees. Request Network offers a secure and decentralized p2p solution to this problem, bypassing banks and 3rd party mediators all together. Request Network is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is “designed to be flexible, last hundreds of years and work with IoT” according to their website.</p>

<p>*Please note that I am not suggesting anyone invest in these technologies. If you are interested, do your own research and make educated investments.</p>

<p>What coins will you be eyeing up next year and why? Let me know in the comments, I’d love to hear!</p>
